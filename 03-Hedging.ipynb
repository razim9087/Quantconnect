    "\n",
    "In order to enable the SP499 we, at first, need to compute the Market Cap of the SP500 and OXY.<br />\n",
    "The market cap can be computed by:\n",
    "\n",
    "**EarningReports.BasicAverageShares.ThreeMonths * EarningReports.BasicEPS.TwelveMonths * ValuationRatios.PERatio**\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we compute the fraction between those two and buy SPY and OXY according to the resulting fractions\n",
    "\n",
    "In Quantconnect, you can get access to the SP500 (or at least the most similar version to it) by adding **self.Universe.Index.QC500** as Universe.\n",
    "Additionally, we add **OXY** and **SPY** to our security list\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compute the market cap we need to get access to the fundamentals. This can be directly done by: <br />\n",
    "**self.Securities[data.Key].Fundamentals** <br />\n",
    "**Important**: data.Fundamentals does not work!<br />\n",
    "Now we can simply calculate the market cap as defined above and sum those caps for all stocks in the SP500.<br />\n",
    "In order to store the market cap for OXY we need to check if the current share contains the OXY object. This can be done via: <br /> \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if \"OXY\" in str(data.Key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Finally we only need to compute the fraction between the OXY market cap and the SP500 total market cap and then buy those equities based on the calculated fractions\n",
    "(Note: Because we added OXY as an equity it occurs two times in OnData, one time within the QC500 universe and one time as a single slice. Thus we check whether the fraction is < 1 before buying)"
